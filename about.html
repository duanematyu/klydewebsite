 			 <h1>Klyde Topino</h1>
				<h5>BSEMC Student</h5>
				<br>
			<p>Hi! My name is Klyde Jefferson Topino, but you can call me Klyde.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I love playing games, because it gives me joy, explores new things, and meet new friends. Playing video games became my best friend since I was young. I don't usually go outside and play with friends, I just play video games at home, sometimes alone and sometimes with my twin brother. I have so many dream jobs that I think of since I was in grade school like being a doctor, astronaut, graphic designer, or basketball player, but playing video games is significant to me, so why not make my own video game. I chose this course, Game development to create and design my own video game, and to make people or gamers enjoy and appreciate it.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Playing basketball is one of my hobbies, and it became my exercise to lose weight. I like to travel, and Korea is the first country that I visited and went there twice with my family. I read some of their cultures because I wanted to study and explore other country's history or culture, especially street foods and tourist spots. I also love listening to Kpop music, especially Twice. Their music is catchy and meaningful, and they inspire and motivate me to study.</p>
